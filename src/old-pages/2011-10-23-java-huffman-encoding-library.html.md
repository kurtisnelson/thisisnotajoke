For a homework assignment in Georgia Tech CS1332, I needed to write some Huffman encoding tools in Java. Since I ended up using generics and writing reusable code, I've thrown it up on my Github at <a href="https://github.com/kurtisnelson/Java-Huffman">https://github.com/kurtisnelson/Java-Huffman</a> for anyone to use.

This software is being put in the public domain with no warranty.
