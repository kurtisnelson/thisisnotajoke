How can tourists be tourists? To be at a park from 9 in the morning till 11 at night requires incredible stamina. Today for example, I woke up at 7AMish and was at Disney's Hollywood Studios at 9:10. At that time there was already an hour wait for things. After doing the highlights there (I had a 1st timer with me) I moved on to Animal Kingdom. Ate lunch at 1 at Rainforest and was starting to feel very tired by then. That is at 1. After doing the highlights there, we moved on to the Magic Kingdom. Arrived at maybe 3 something. I was beat by then. At about 6 we gave up and quit, and I am now here sitting in bed with my laptop writing this while logs are still falling and rockets still launching for at least another hour. And to do this for 3 or 4 days? Open to close? These tourists are mental.

My legs ache, I am hungry for frozen pizza and parades are still running. These tourists are without a break in their day. And I am beat halfway through. Supposedly at my physical prime. While being beaten by infants. At least I'm not mental.
