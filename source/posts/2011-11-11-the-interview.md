Welcome, grab a seat, sit down, make yourself comfortable.

Do you need anything? A coffee? What would you like in it? I'll get you some sugar, I'll be right back.

So what interests you in this position? I know the benefits are excellent, but that's pretty standard for your role in this industry .

Ah, you are drawn to working for me. Great! That's what I like to hear. Give me a second to look through your portfolio.

Wonderful. Nice work here, I like the risks you took with it, they really pay off. As you know, working for me means I expect you take part in our endeavors to live a healthy lifestyle. Also, as you probably have figured out, this role is not appropriate for married or even in a relationship prospects due to the commitment involved. I can't actually ask you your relationship due to hiring laws, but I'm strongly suggesting you volunteer that information to me so we can make the best decision.

Oh, you eat only vegan? Interesting. I'm a pretty big fan of meat myself, I find a way to live healthy while still eating it.

Are you a morning person or an evening one? I find that it is of utmost importance that you would tend to be awake when I am so I can call you at any time.

What's one of the hardest challenges you've had to tackle in a previous position? Oh, you've been fired by a previous boss? What was the reason?

Wait, you've worked in this same role for someone else before?

Well, uh, that about wraps things up here. Tell my receptionist to send the next prospect in.

Oh, and remind her to stop accepting applications via the mail from Russians.
