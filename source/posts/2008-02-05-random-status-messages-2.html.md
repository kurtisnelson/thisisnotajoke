Who me?  <li>Confound the Law of Expanding Homework!This accursed law which declares that an assignment will, under all circumstances, take exactly the amount of time one has to complete it.

Curse IB!  <li>brb.  <li>taking a survey on clothes and getting paid for it!  <li>nhs form thing  <li> <p>Necesito practicar.... <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ___<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; ________/ / Piano<br>/________\__\<br>|____________| ____<br>|| || || | |<br>y mi espanol. :-D</p> <li> <p>Food</p> <li> <p>House</p> <li> <p>W.W.B.D.<br>What would Bach do?<br>He'd go practice Partita No.2 in D minor, 1st mvt.</p> <li> <p>When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall/ and in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call/ Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove/ for the first time in my life, I see I need love/ There I was giggling about the gamesâ€¦</p></li></ul> <p>And then you have the people with old away messages that applied last week:</p> <ul> <li>study for calc</li></ul> <p>Have any guesses on the personalities of the people with these statuses?
