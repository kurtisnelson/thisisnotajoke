<p style="text-align: center">Windows Vista RC2 is a large improvement over all previous releases and has fixed all of my previous problems. The working NVIDIA drivers were included with the install and Aero worked from the start. It runs much faster, but still just running IM and firefox sucks up 500 MB of RAM. The above picture is my first screen shot from Vista</p>
