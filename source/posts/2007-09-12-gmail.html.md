<p>I use Gmail for all of my email, and consider it the easiest and best free solution for your email. Using Gmail, you can even keep your old email address. You never have to worry about losing your address book or any of your emails again, as they are all on Google's server. If you use multiple computers, your mail stays synced up between all of them. And it has a good <a href="http://thisisnotajoke.com/menu/deltoidevaluation.php">antispam</a> filter.(Link is a bot trap)</p>
