1:45 - I see down the street in town square Shane is scampering towards the Christmas tree to flip it off. Everything is automated about the parade, to the windows on the street automatically cracking open so the soundtrack can be heard, yet the gigantic 50 foot Christmas tree in town square manually has to have it's lights flipped off every parade. All the other lights in town square flip off, and I hear the electrosynthomagnetic electrical sounds of Disney's Main Street Electrical Parade! (dun-duh!) At the same time up here in the hub, the 10 minute announcement is made. The crowd gets excited, and I...don't. Now that we are close to the parade, foot traffic has picked up through my area since Guests are starting to be redirected around the route. Of course I love to remind people out loud of the fastest way to the exit, through the rose-garden, behind the popcorn cart, and around and through the bypass. From there they will be wisked away magically to the front of the park where they can happily hop a monorail and get out of the park reducing the crowds from the nice 50,000 to a slightly better 49,999. One less family with a crying child trying to find a spot to watch the parade at the absolute last minute. I see Tinkerbell's head over the crowd slowly working her way towards me. Once she finally arrives, I can switch from my please keep moving, to a please keep moving, this is not a parade viewing area.
