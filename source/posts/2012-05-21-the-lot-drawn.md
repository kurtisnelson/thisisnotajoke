Imagine a place where all you have to worry about is nothing. Food appears when you need it. You are surrounded by pleasant company. You have no job, money has no meaning, what you enter with is all you have and will ever have. The weather is beautiful and taken care of, the temperature warm in the day but cool in the night, an endless supply of sunscreen at an arm's length.

The catch is there is no inside. To stay in this utopia, you must stay on the lot. As long as you do that, you wil be fed, there will be a bathroom, and you will be kept safe. There is no electricity or modernÂ conveniences. For how long would you stay in this utopia without ruining it? At any time, you can go inside, leave the lot and quit. You've still got free will. But how long until you try the forbidden fruit out of boredom?
