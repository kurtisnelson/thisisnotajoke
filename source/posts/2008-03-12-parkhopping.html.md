Parkhopping (verb): The insane act of trying to stuff more things into your day than possible. Pushed by Disney because...?
Today was my first actual attempt at professional park hopping. Before I had just done the amateur switch at closing to somewhere else. Today was my first time visiting 3 parks in less than 6 hours. Parked at Epcot, monorailed over to Magic Kingdom, monorailed back, walked to my car, went back in the park, walked back out to my car, drove to MGM, walked in, walked, walked, walked, finally found the prop shop, realized it was closed, and headed back to guest services. Why? To collect as many free passholder lithographs in one day as possible. (The coupons expire next week, and mine arrived this week) What I do not understand is the actual point of park hopping. Did Disney create it to start marketing to ADD prone Americans? Is it meant to appeal to people with no time so they can do more? The whole irony of park hopping is that less is done. A park hop takes at least 20 minutes, involving waiting and riding two trams, and drive time. From my experience, buses are even slower. Instead, more could be done staying in one park. If you are on a multiday vacation, relax. There is no need to get all the major attractions done in one day. Even if you are on a one day vacation, make the most of it. Don't waste your time jumping around and doing extra walking. With the way Disney parks are designed, there is always a bit of a main street to walk down in every park. There is distance to help seperate you from the rest of the world, and when you hop, you have to travel this distance. And the worst crime: Hopping to/from Magic Kingdom. Because of the 7 Seas Lagoon, you lose even more time. If you are hopping midday, there are also less monorails running, upping your travel time once more. Ignore the Disney marketing, save money on your park tickets, and have a better vacation. Don't park hop.
