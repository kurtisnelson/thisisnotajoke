Today I had my first experience with Disney customer service. It was not positive, but they did fix the problem.

I called (407)560-PASS to attempt to figure out why I have never received the Mickey Monitor and the corresponding lithograph coupons. First off, there is no menu option for existing passholders to contact guest relations, so I punched 0. After at least 5 transfers, I finally got to the right person. They checked my information and for some reason I had not been marked to receive Mickey Monitor. They said they fixed it and I should receive the appropriate issue in a couple of weeks. That's great and all except that <em>the coupons expire next week</em>. I ask what he can do to get me the coupons by Saturday or if I can pick them up. Nothing. I ask to speak to a supervisor with more power, and he says he is out. Now I called again, punched 0, and am currently on hold waiting for them to fix it. Ok, now they said the best thing I could do was fill out the contact form on the website. I asked for a supervisor, and he is being much more helpful. Mr. Supervisor said he is putting one in the mail for me today, and I should receive it before Saturday.

For anyone else's future reference, call and ask for guest services. If needed, request a supervisor.
