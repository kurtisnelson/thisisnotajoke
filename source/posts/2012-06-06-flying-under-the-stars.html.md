title: 'Flying Under the Stars'

---

I’m flying under the stars, the wind blowing in my face, music blasting, the night feeling all there, nothing but dark sound, and light wind, and a slight rumble in the seat underneath. The cool wind passes along my forehead, lifting my hair and strewing it about making a mess, but a nice mess.

When the car slows, my hair remains on end, shapen by the journey. The stars are fully out, the moon turning orange; I smell skunk, then bread, then you, then nothing. Just the senses are loaded, everything but taste is overwhelmed, I can feel the wind, see the wind, hear the wind, smell the wind, but I can’t taste the wind. I can only imagine the taste of the smell, the fresh pine fading into the rank pastures, it all looks, smells, feels, sounds, but no taste. So awake, so alive; so real, so raw; so strong.

The bright stars contrast the dark sky, the hard sound the silence of the night.
