I enjoyed reading short science fiction stories by Phillip K Dick, Issac Asimov, etc. Over the years, I've found some podcasts that release short fiction (often weekly) under a creative commons license (i.e. free for anyone to listen to). The ones I enjoy the most are <a href="http://thisisnotajoke.com/wp-admin/www.drabblecast.org">The Drabblecast</a>, "strange stories by strange authors for strange listeners, such as yourself" produced weekly by the wonderful voice actor Norm Sherman, and <a href="http://thisisnotajoke.com/wp-admin/www.escapepod.org">The Escape Pod</a>, weekly science-fiction stories hosted by Steve Eley. The Drabblecast is typically 20 minutes or less, but Escape Pod episodes can run up to 30-45 minutes or more.

I also enjoy the podiobook <a href="http://thisisnotajoke.com/wp-admin/www.playingforkeepsnovel.com">Playing For Keeps</a> by Mur Lafferty, a story about a society with super heros, super villians, and some not-so-super Third Wavers, who still have minor powers. I enjoy <a href="http://succeedinevil.com/">How to Succeed in Evil</a>, about an evil efficiency consultant so depressed by inept villians that he turns to being a villian himself, but it doesn't come out frequently enough for me. Other podcasts I know of but don't really listent to often are <a href="http://xmone.libsyn.com/">The X-1 Podcast</a>, <a href="http://thegreatbeyond.libsyn.com/">The Great Beyond</a>, <a href="http://welltoldtales.com/">Well Told Tales</a>, and <a href="http://voicesoftomorrow.libsyn.com/">Voices of Tomorrow</a>.

I listen to the Pseudonews <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/radionews">The Onion</a>in podcast form, and really enjoy this as well.
