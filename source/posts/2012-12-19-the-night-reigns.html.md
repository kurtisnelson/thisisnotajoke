title: 'The Night Reigns'

---

<p>Oh the beautiful night sky, marked by the tall rectangles jutting out into it's nature. The pure sound of the night, interuppted by sirens and vehicles and construction. This city is not pure, this city is broken. This city cannot stand forever, but the night can. We humans can only do so much to keep it up, ultimately it is out of our hands. Utimately this city will end, and a new one will begin. To be here when that happens is to be on the edge of the world, the borders of time, to exist outside of humanity, to exist above all else.</p>

<p>The ground underneath the roads has been kept from the sun for so many years, and it will burst forth towards the sun, exhuberant to feel warmth again, to be pulled up from under the weight of a million cars, traversing across it's back day after day, never ceasing. To no longer have the water run away from it, but to have the water join it, to be able to expand and contract under the sun freely, no longer engineered to stay put.</p>

<p>The rectangles will gain extra geometry, losing their artificial perfection, breaking out into their truest form. The fire within will be extinguished, replaced by a fire outside. Their hearts will have long left the shells, leaving them as a husk of humanity, a relic of the past.</p>

<p>The night sky will reign above the world, with only nature below it, nothing disturbing it, complete and pure peace. And then it will be great.</p>
