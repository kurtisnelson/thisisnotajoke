title: 'New Site Design Done'

---

Well, the newest version of thisisnotajoke.com has launched, and we now run WordPress for a backend. The theme is based on Almost-Spring with heavy CSS modifications done thanks to Spencer of <a href="http://gurnk.com" target="_blank" >Gurnk</a>. With WordPress, it is now easier to update the website, and I am able to integrate my personal <a href="http://thisisnotajoke.com/blog">blog</a> into the website. I am also in the process of purchasing iHost to make purchasing hosting easier and quicker. One question for any WordPress people out there: How can I seperate my blog stuff better from the rest of my site?
