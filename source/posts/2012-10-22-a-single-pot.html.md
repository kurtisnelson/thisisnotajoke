title: 'A Single Pot'

He gives me the power to bring light with me wherever I go, visible to all but accepted by few. Why don't more carry it with them; wearing it in their eyes, their voice, their breath, their being?

Instead they carry darkness with them; a burden on their backs, a pot of water balanced on their head. Hopefully I can at least help them see that pot of water they've been delicately carrying on their head, balancing it through life, avoiding letting it fall and break open out into the open.

Sometimes you just have to give the pot a push, throwing them off balance unexpectedly.

And I can do that. I've got the ability and the freedom to do that because of where I am right now. If I carried the pot for them, I would just be overburdened myself. Only He can carry another's pot and not be overcome by the weight. I need to only carry my own right now, for I need to preserve my strength for when I must be part of a team carrying two.
