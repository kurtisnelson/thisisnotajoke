title: 'Steam Cleaned and Spotless'

---

Every night, every inch of Main Street USA is steam washed. Not hosed down, not just pressure washed, but steam pressure washed. Is it costly? Yep. But I'd eat off of the street in the morning at park opening.

Last week, The Magic Kingdom had incredibly long operating hours, some days being open 7am - 3am and then opening again at 7am. Guests are generally allowed in view of Main Street 10 minutes before open and will linger on Main Street 1.5 hours after close on a normal night, maybe 20 minutes on a EMH 3am close. This means that the 3rd shift custodial show keeping team gets three and a half hours to get the park show ready, while on a normal schedule they have 8 or more hours. Yet when you walk right down the middle of Main Street USA the next morning it is always as spotless as ever. That's some serious behind the scenes magic.
