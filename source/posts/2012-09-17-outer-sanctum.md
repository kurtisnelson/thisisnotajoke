The clouds go by, flowing fast between the buildings. A light drizzle is ongoing, just a slight pit-pat on the trees. In the distance, spotlights scan the clouds trying to draw attention to some unknown attraction.

Down on the corner sits a man, in a wheelchair. No one is around him and everyone ignores him. He says he is hungry and just needs a bite, but he really needs to escape. His legs are numb, his skin pale, no blood flowing proper. He's only 30 but is as strong as 70. Hey friend, how are you doing today? Could you spare a few? No? How are you doing today? Because I am sure I can make you feel better by the fact that you are not I.

The M on the side of the building grows, laser lights come up from the pool, and a distant cheer is heard. The side of the building is filled with color, and the green fairy is flowing freely. Thump, thump emanates from that corner, a stream of people going back and forth, loud friends walk in groups to and from. They are dressed loudly, vociferously, with no care in the world. It's past midnight and they are still going strong.

He just wants to sleep. Head bent over in his lap, blanket over his head, he sits. He sits in his sanctuary, but even then it is still difficult to reach his personal sanctum. He has no privacy but what he can create in his mind, with even the clothes on his back not his own. Everyone who passes by gives a look but few step beyond that. All he can do is occasionally look back with a pleading look on his face, but who wants to look at the sad face on the end of a wretched body curled up against a stoplight in the dark, cold, rain? He can barely speak because of what has happened to his voice, all he can utter is "food". It is now the witching hour, but he looks like he has come through far, far worse.

The shiny clean cars with the shiny neat people just drive by. They don't notice a bump on the sidewalk, they are just in a hurry to make it to wherever on time. Their windshield blocks out the world for them, and they don't have to worry about anything outside of their small, pristine, bubble. As long as they get from point A to points X,Y, and Z on time and back home for dinner with the kids, it doesn't matter. Their wiper blades will take care of anything that blocks their pristine view.

A man with nothing but his body can do so much more than a man with everything. He has absolute freedom, needs to be nowhere at any time, and gets to provide his own brand of entertainment. Some half-thoughtful person might give him a random possession, such as a souvenir from the last sports game. What the man does with this is all up to him: to use it as a tool, to bargain for food, or to just simply self-entertain. He can get great simple joy from shaking it at passerby wearing the opposing team colors and yelling "you can't argue with a man in a wheelchair". Or he can simply sit there quietly with it remaining in his lap, looking to at least get a glancing look from bystanders.

The clouds still float by, slightly slower now that the storm has passed. The streets are quiet as it is getting late. The lights in the skyscrapers slowly turn off as the evening comes to a close. And the man, that man; still sits on the corner, waiting for life to pass him by.
