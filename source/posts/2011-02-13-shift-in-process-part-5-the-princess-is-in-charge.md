Make sure you start with <a href="http://thisisnotajoke.com/2011/01/29/shift-in-process-pt1/">Part 1</a>

2:30 - Tonight is one of the rare nights where so much happens in the hub closely together that you can just sit down at 5PM and stay for 3 hours. It's a Wednesday night in early December. The whole park is decked out for Christmas, the crowds not awful, the weather beautiful. I'm finally able to break out the wonderful blazer on top of the vest and not sweat to death. It really completes the outfit and rolls back the clock nicely to the turn of the century. At 1815 every night during this time of year, Mickey and Minnie come out on the castle stage to help Cinderella decorate her castle. Of course this is fine and dandy for Mickey and Minnie, but makes us have to quit our prodding of Guests through pathways until the castle is lit. Some of us know the timing of the show so well we can aid children in personally lighting the castle. After the lighting, I reclear my walkways and continue to wait.

1:50 - The parade will be stepping off in town square in 5 minutes. This means I have 10 minutes to make sure my section of the hub is prepared. I walk the curbs making sure if any body parts are in the road the attached body is sitting on the curb. Of course, this is a battle when I come across the family of 25 who has half a blanket in the street and appear to be having a picnic consisting of corn dog bites from Casey's, funnel cakes from Sleepy Hollow, and the requisite Ice Cream Parlor sundae (my favorite in park dessert). They of course want to watch the parade, but do not seem to understand that it will not be a good view looking at the bottom of the tires as 5 ton floats sink them into the pavement. At least there's not a protein spill in the middle of the path here like there was earlier smack dab in alignment with the very busy Casey-Ice Cream crosswalks. Luckily, it's not a halloween party where I have to worry about Ike killing someone in a stroller, so it's a pretty easy clear and I am able to go back to assisting at keeping the Gazebo flowing.
