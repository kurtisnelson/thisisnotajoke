<p>Pidgin is the best instant messenger program available. It is compatible with all of your friends on AIM, MSN, Yahoo!, Jabber, Google Talk, ICQ and IRC. A bonus feature is that instead of people&rsquo;s screen names, you can set the software to show real names instead. Pidgin had a plugin based structure, meaning many features can be added by downloading more software. For example, I have a plugin that is used by everyone is in a conversation and has the effect of writing all messages being written in code and burned after reading. Gaim is also an open source project, meaning the code that runs it is freely available for download and modification. Because of this, this software is one-hundred percent free.</p>
