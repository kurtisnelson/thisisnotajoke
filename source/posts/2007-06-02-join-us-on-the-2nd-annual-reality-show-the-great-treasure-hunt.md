<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:at="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/at">We still have spots left! If you want to be a contestant in a full-scale reality show, just send in your application. I helped personally plan this show, and it is not easy, but it will be tons of fun. Below is the trailer from last summer's show. All of the episodes can be seen on Google Video by doing a search for Road Rules Elevate. Get the <a href="http://elevatesm.org/downloads/RealityShow07.pdf">Form</a> for this year's show!</p>
