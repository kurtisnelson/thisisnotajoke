A screech and a bang. That’s all I witnessed at first. But then I looked out and saw it, a crumpled rectangle aimed towards the sky, a grey box shredded to pieces. Two pedestrians standing in shock on the sidewalk. The homeless man on the church steps peeking out from under his coverings. At this point, I knew I needed to get down there, drawn to it via some perverse human instinct.

It’s freezing out, and a long haired man is standing next to his destroyed car shivering. Another man is standing nonchalantly next to his destroyed car, seemingly with apathy. The homeless man has his covers pulled back up over his head trying to sleep. The apathetic man’s companion is still in the front passenger seat, the airbags deployed, the seat no longer in the front. Yet the man is just standing there. A young couple is still standing there on the sidewalk, holding each other close, looking confused as to what just happened.

Hordes of properly oriented rectangles arrive upon the intersection with no regard to the straight lines on the ground. A stretcher is pulled out of the back of one and setup next to the man of apathy, and they try to pull the passenger door open. But it will not budge. The apathy remains, his coat over his shoulder, a look of nothing on his face. They all return to their trucks to regroup and gather equipment. Shears, a bike pump, an oxygen tank, random heavy instruments. Some surround the car, some stay leaning back on their trucks. They go to work.

The long haired man just stands on the curb, dejected. He asks if he can get some stuff out of his trunk, but is told to wait until they can clean up the leaking fluids. “But they are props, for the kids. The car can go away, the kids need my shows.”

A scream comes out of the car of apathy, and the homeless man pulls his blanket over his head and rolls over trying to get back to sleep.

“My car did that to her” the long haired man sighs.

I just stand there with my hands in my pockets unsure of what to do.

The screaming woman is loaded into the back of an ambulance, her companion still pacing around. “We’re ready to go” the paramedics tell him, and he lumbers over to the back of the ambulance and hops in. Apathy and his companion leave the scene, their car left up a tree and on a trashcan, split down the front, with another car in the passenger door.

As quickly as they arrived, the team starts to cleanup, breaking out brooms and sweeping the trash into the apathetic car. I ask the long hair man how he is going to get home, and he says he is leaving with his car, for he needs to get his props out of the trunk and get them home. “Just this morning I thought I couldn’t make my car payments, and now I don’t need to.”

He gets in the tow truck, and it pulls away.

All that is left at the scene is glistening rubies by the passenger door and shards of glass strewn about the road. A piece of plastic bumper sits one step down from the homeless man, the only human being who saw the whole event yet didn’t move a muscle.
