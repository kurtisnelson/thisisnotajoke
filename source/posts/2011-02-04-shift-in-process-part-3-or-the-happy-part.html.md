3:30 - Ah, the Gazebo. Many memories have been made here (and I'm not getting paid to plug memories and general happiness). There was that one Saturday night, it was quieter than expected, an under 50k day. Nick and I had setup the area with 2 rolls of tape. (Yes: two whole rolls!) At this point, we were milling about on the Fantasyland Bridge making tape art to redirect traffic through the rose garden at a later point. It was mid-november, so we were finally able to break out the 1920s era jackets. In summary, we looked Disney. A group of young college girls walks up to Nick and I and asks if we can take a picture. So of course, being the Cast Members that we are, we say sure and wait for them to assemble themselves in a group. When they look ready, they flag us down. Of course, we are expecting to be handed a camera. Why it would take two of us to do so makes no sense, but neither do 105% of Guest requests. They actually wanted a picture with us. Not the usual can you take a picture of us, or, can we have a picture of you in your absurd Halloween purple pants outfit. These random Guests who we had barely interacted with wanted us to be a part of their vacation memory. Just because of the fact we had pointed out where they could get a front row seat for the parade in an hour. We made simple yet effective magic with no effort. All by just putting some masking tape on the ground. And we've only been on stage for a few minutes.
