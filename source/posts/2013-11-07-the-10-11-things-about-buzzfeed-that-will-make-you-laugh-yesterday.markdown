1. Someone actually has the job of deciding if the list should be 6, 7, 8, or 9 things, and how many memes to include.

2. Everyone knows that Top X lists are what happens when a room full of writers is completely out of content yet still has a piece due the next day.

3. There's this site called Meme Generator that I too could use to build a news site.

4. Citing sources is so 2012, I just steal my best jokes from Twitter.

5. If you don't share these 10 things with 10 of your closest friends, it is the same as clubbing baby seals. So go share this now and then change your profile picture to a monkey so that I know you did it.

6. If you run out of ideas, you can just paste a random lolcat inline.

7. If you run out of ideas, you can just paste a second random lolcat inline.

8. By reading and sharing this list, you are somehow magically helping children in Africa. I promise. So share this some more.

9. If you post a link to this article, your friends will think you are well read and you will instantly become well respected on social media.

10. 1) Insert unrelated movie quote here. 2) Add a meme. 3) ??? 4) Profit!

11. I too can make a list of arbitrary length and fill it with completely meaningless drivel. Does this warrant an IPO yet?
