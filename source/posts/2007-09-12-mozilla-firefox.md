title: 'Mozilla Firefox'

---

<p>If I can't have Mozilla Firefox on a computer, I refuse to use it. (Except 
  in the case of these school computers) Firefox is a full replacement for Internet 
  Explorer that is easier to use and can have a whole lot more features. Firefox 
  supports add-ons called extensions. for example, I have an extension that will 
  automatically strip all advertising from any web page. Also with Firefox, you 
  will get almost no spyware because by default Firefox is more secure than IE. 
  Firefox is called open-source software, meaning that the code driving it is 
  free to download and modify for any person. Henceforth, Firefox is a completely 
  free program.</p>
