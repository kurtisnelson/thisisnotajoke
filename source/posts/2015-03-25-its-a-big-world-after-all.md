Small me crosses a big world;
the big world that we are circumscribed in.
In a matter of mere hours we can seemingly vanquish this world,
envelope all of it in one human mind,
all that is needed is a miniscule metal tube jetting across it.

But even as much, with every new time I cross it the world just continues to get bigger.
I cannot contain the scope of it in my mind, no matter how much I try.
I can try to see it all, as much as I can, but it will just continue to grow, to expand, to morph to change; I can always return and rediscover more new, beautiful & greater things, even better things.

Humanity wishes it was God, to see the world all together in one cohesive entity, one neatly tied up product, a bow on top with plot & purpose defined. But all we will ever see is glimpses of it, a small very tiny fraction, infinitesimal. Even the oldest, wisest, well traveled kings will have only seen a microscopic, insignificant component of this world, much less of the universe.

I am on my quest to find it all, me up in the sky with pink clouds endlessly flowing by the window. The drone of the lone engine lolls me towards a sleepless rest, the faint smell of exhaust mixing with the perfume of the woman a few rows down. This small little square foot of cloth underneath my feet has seen more miles than I ever will in my life, passed numerous storms, sunrises and sunsets, more inches of the earth than can fit on a map.

Man will try to go to the ends of the earth, some will think they have succeeded but none will truly reach it. There are no ends, just more beginnings at the edges. I have barely begun to discover it myself.
