The pitter patter of the road and the patter of my fingers as they fly. They fly across the glass in a dance full of character. At one point they would fly across the keys but now they fly differently, freely, dynamically, constantly, non-stop. As car flys by, the keys fly faster than they can express the scenes that go by. The raw scenes, the grass, the trees, the road. It all moves along faster than I can recognize. People move by, fast flowing, ebbing currents, coming and going, leaving, dieing, loving, learning. They fly by in my life like the road at night, barely under me before I just pass further over them. If only there were a speed limit on life, with the police to pull you over when you go too fast. Am I typing to fast? Am I over the limit on the words I can say, they places I can be, the things I can do, the raw horsepower of my life? When do I stop? When do I brake, change my tires, realign, change the belt and get my title transferred to a new owner?
