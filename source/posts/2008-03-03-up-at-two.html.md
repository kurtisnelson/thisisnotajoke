The sun is rising, I, going to bed.
The birds are waking, I, going to sleep.

In the middle of the night,
The air is quiet.
Everything is asleep
With absolute silence.

The world goes to bed,
I wake.

Going against nature is tough,
Making my night very rough.
Everywhere is dark
Except my head.

The sun is rising, I, going to bed.
The birds are waking, I, going to sleep.
Something is wrong in my head.
