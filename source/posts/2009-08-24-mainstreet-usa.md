A couple, likely european, walks down the street on the left side, oblivious to the balloon hawker. Children skip ahead or lag behind their parents taking in the many sights that only they can see. Trolley tracks dissappear into a mob of lost tourists, planning where they are going to go next. The sky is perfectly clear, adding to the relaxed atmosphere. The clocks are all partially hidden, no one actually cares what they say except the balloon seller. The castle at the end of the street is taken for granted, ignored, just a marker of where everyone is walking. The street is completely shaded, no need to hurry to get out of the sun. The sun only hits where it is aestetically pleasing for it to, on the tops of buildings, the castle. The whole street is meant to relax, and it most definitely does so.
