title: 'A Brief Vacation from Reality'

---

She sits quietly next to me, the wind blows in and she pushes her hair behind her ear in an attempt to quelch the wildness of it. Whenever she does this she looks over in my durection ever so slightly, checking to see if I notice. I do, but she does not realize it. Still though, the wind keeps blowing, and we keep going.

Yet we are not getting anywhere, we know where we are going, but have no idea how we should actually get there. The bus we are on just drives into the dark, chilly, night, no specific destination in mind, just on a grand adventure. We may be sitting close to one another, but we are just two similar passengers on the same bus.

The bus growls over a final hill and pulls into a dark, empty field. Apparently this is it, the mutual destination of a fleet of buses, all carrying similar passengers, only in destination. All of use end up at the same muddy, straw covered field, and for what? A brief vacation from reality?

But it's not in the destination, but in the hourney to and from. The field could have been former orange groves, filled with a magical reality, or a pristine beach hidden in the wilderness of a forbidden island. Instead these similar people have chose a muddy field in the middle of somewhere, nothing grand, nothing special. Having journied here together, they are glad to have arrived.

Brief minutes later, they gather themselves back up, pile on again in the exact same formation, just to start the same journey on again, going nowhere. And I sit with them in silence. I've tried to understand these people, but have always failed. But her next to me gets it. We exchange glances, understanding each other without saying a word. And she returns to sitting quietly next to me, the wind blowing her hair.
