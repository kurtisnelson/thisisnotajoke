title: 'The Ivory Tower'

---

I walk along the street, and come across something different. The sidewalk I have been on is cracked, dirty, old, brittle, so many have walked on it, and it has always been in the same sad state of affair. No maintenance, no attention, desolate sidewalks in the back side of the city. But among these dark carcasses of buildings stands an ivory tower. Indescribably tall, sticking up, a beacon, a light above all else. It is so clearly different from the surroundings, so clean and pure compared to all else, looking like it has been cleaned perpetually, no dirt ever even allowed to set upon it, an ivory tower.

The sidewalk in front of it looks freshly set, pressure cleaned and double bleached. There is lush landscaping around the base, evergreen even in the middle of winter. Yet there are no leaves on the ground. Everything is white, light or green. So pure, so fine, set amongst such dirt and grime. But the tower is here, and the tower is here to stay.

I meander up to the front door and pull it wide open effortlessly. I enter the lobby, a vast open space, wide, tall, open. It seems to be composed purely of marble and air. In the center are banks upon banks of elevators all labeled with their destination, none of which appear to be mine. I continue around the lobby, meandering, hoping to discover what I need. I happen upon a small non-intimidating information desk, behind which is a napping older man. There is a tented nameplate reading "Peter" sitting on the desk in front of him. I approach the desk, but do not want to wake him as he appears to be at peace. Instead I walk up to the banks of elevators, hoping to figure out which one I should ride. They all appear to go higher in the building but none go to the top floor where I wish to be. For that, one must take the stairs for no elevator has the strength to take anything completely to the top. Only through one's own willpower are you able to climb to the top of the tower, above the cloud, above the world, away from the pollution of the city. I find the nearest stairwell and start upon that journey now. When I will reach the top only the tower knows.
