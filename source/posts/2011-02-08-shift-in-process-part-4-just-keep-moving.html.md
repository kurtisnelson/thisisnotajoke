3:29 - The waiting begins, Â but this is not just any old regular waiting. This is paid waiting, with the small extra of having to deal with 15,000 incredibly well behaved human beings. Here at the Gazebo, it is up to me to keep 100 ft of walkway in two totally different directions with the added bonus of it being wrapped around a corner. In other words, it's time to pace. I'm armed with the weapon of choice, the Blue Light Wand, which can instill movement into all but the most stubborn Guests. That...if...you just keep moving, just keep moving, life isn't all that grim. It's like the small child who can't step on the cracks in the sidewalk because they are lava. Except in this case, if you stand on my line on the sidewalk I become your closest buddy until you are no longer on my line on the sidewalk. Only an hour and 44 to go. Right now it's easy, only the curb is filled and I can direct Guests to nearby front row seating. I take advantage of a quiet moment to interact with the guests.

3:25 - I love overhearing Guest conversations. On a quiet day, I always get the family that realizes how good of a vacation date they chose. They thought ahead too. They have their small blanket on the curb, a child on it clapping and excited to see Custodial walk down the road in their bright costume. The Mom and Dad are sitting on either side of the child, pointing out shiny interesting things to them. They got to the parade route two hours early, so I take out the time to point out *my* favorite spot and make them feel like insiders. Unfortunately, there is a difference between Parents and parents.
