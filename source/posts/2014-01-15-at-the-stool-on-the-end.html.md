A man just sits at the bar the whole night, at the stool on the end. People hover around him, never really stopping to talk. He drinks out of a distinct glass, the only one of its type in sight: a tall round glass with a handle sticking cleanly out of the side, not quite a mug, not quite a tumbler. It has letters engraved on the side of it, clean and clearly: "SAL". He clearly has a name around here, but why does he look so lonely and forlorn? He does not have a name out there, only in here at the stool at the end. Anywhere else he has near unlimited resources, an army of subordinates to call on, money for anything he wants, yet he chooses to sit at the bar the whole night, at the stool on the end. It is because what he gets in here is different; to him this drunken state is his reality and this reality his bad drunken dream.

And I do not fault him a bit.

I will not, and I cannot ever wear his shoes, but I can imagine in his shoes. The first 25 years of his life were a lie, a lie culminating in a marriage to a woman he did not love or even like, a woman he married just so he could fit in, so his lie would be feasible. But for him having a wife is as natural as a motherless child; a complete lack of the needed love to survive results in a false survival. His reality consists of a world that tells him he is completely and utterly broken, a conundrum of a man, a catch-22 of nature, a one to thirty five roulette payout of the womb; this gets to his very core. He tried hard to beat the odds, playing football, wrestling, dating, marrying, but like any game of chance, the house wins with time.

So when time will just win, what can one do except attempt to stop it? Freeze reality, stuff it in a jar, and shove it in the back of the bar along with the 20-year scotch and the fortified wine to be thawed out later when some interested soul is willing to enjoy the layers of bitterness on the palate all at once, unfrozen and whole. But until that time comes, it sits on the shelf aging, gaining complexity, loosing flavors to the air, the last of the living organisms in it squelched out by the enormous amount of ethanol. He lives in that frozen reality in the jar, spinning out of control and being consumed by the chemical reactions, oblivious to his age and stature or his peers on the shelf. It is in this state that he feels comfortable and safe.

A day will come though when the jar must be opened, the foreign air felt on the liquid surface once again. If it is done with care, all will be well and he will be able to re-enter the present with reality intact and feel the cool wet air of reinvigorating spring once again. But just as easily as the jar is opened in spring, it can be opened at the end of fall, the winter destruction being the first thing felt again in years, and the jar will crack and the contents will spill out over the ground wasted, a mess to be cleaned up or allowed to wallow and evaporate into the atmosphere.

The best we can do is open the jar on the stool at the end of the bar in spring and hope it flourishes and lives again for wasting a finely tempered drink is a travesty against god.
