title: 'The Question'

---

What is, what is not, what is to be, what was, what is. That is the question now.

For what purpose, what reason, what sub-concious yearning, what illicit thought do we act? For what we do now matters later not yesterday, so our thoughts should not be in the past, but merely use the past as a corpus to decide the future. For the future mat ters more than the past, but cannot exist without the other.

Without a past, the future is nothing, for time is just relative, moments linked together like the words in a sentance. Without context, the future is nothing. Without context, this sentence is nothing. In nothing, there is nothing. But with anything, something is.

Our thoughts, our actions, our lives have more context than we can grasp or remember, subtexts to the supertext, subconcious to the concious, an id to the ego. But all that is ephemeral, our actions are not. They have permanence, repercussions, ripples above and below the surface, seen and unseen, deliberate and accidental. What we do matters, what we think does not. But what we think is generally what we do, and doing without thinking is dangerous.

So think before you do, but bias towards action. For inaction dispels momentum, and without momentum, matters will stay at rest. And what good is the past if the future is sitting still, at absolute zero, completely without life?
