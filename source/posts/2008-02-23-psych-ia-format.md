So I wanted to get the proper format for the psych IA. While not having a 100% guarantee, this should work and should make the table of contents easier (just put anything you want in the table of contents as "Heading 1" and make sure to update the field by right clicking on it, hit "update field" and select "update entire field"). Of course, you need to put your own candidate number and title page.
