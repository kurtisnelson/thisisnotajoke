<p>Google talk is now my favorite instant messaging system, with one major caveat: no one else uses it. So my new mission is to convert people. The first feature is ease of use. My mom even did not need to be taught how to use it. Second, it now has a great voicemail feature that will allow you to leave a voicemail with any email address, with no requirement of being able to open an attachment. Finally, there is the new feature of it showing all users exactly what music you are listening to at that time.</p><p>Recently, Google has linked Google Talk in your Gmail with AIM. This means that you can now log into your AIM account from Gmail.
