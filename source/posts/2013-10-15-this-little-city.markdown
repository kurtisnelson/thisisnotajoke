This little city, so sparse, so young. But it has greatness yet to come. One day it will be in history with New York and London, one day far in the future. This little city, so dead, so sleepy. But on occasion, it comes alive. Why can't it stay alive like others? Why must it sleep? For sleep and night is but a human derivation of nature, nature does not cease, God does not cease, yet humanity ceases nightly here. Let's keep it alive, be alive, go for broke, be broke, but alive.

Buildings will grow faster than weeds, faster than cranes can put themselves together, the towel of babel is real, just how many can we build before God tears them down. Mud begets concrete leading to steel utimately ending in glass. Glass walls, glass windows, glass roofs, glass houses, growing glass faster than the forces that groom it from sand, for soon we will have glass cranes building our glass towers, no stones near to tear them down.

Humans being humans will some day appear with a small stone in palm, ready to be thrown. We will throw the stones, by choice or coercion by nature, the glass will shatter, buildings will fall, but we will just build them higher still. We must build them higher still, as that is what us mortals know how to do; we erect, form, fashion, and shape the terrain around us. Stone in the past, glass now, new elements in the future. But build we will, destroy we will, live we will.

This city. This child of New York, Chicago, America. One day I will tell my children of this city and what it used to be, just this little city.
