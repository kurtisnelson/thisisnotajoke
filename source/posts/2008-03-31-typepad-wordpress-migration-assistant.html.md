While helping a client migrate his blog from Typepad to Wordpress, the most tedious part was updating the post slugs to keep old links intact. I wrote a script that will go through all Wordpress posts, and change their slugs to typepad format. ThisÂ  can be combined with the forward old slugs plugin to keep old links intact, while still using Wordpress's much cleaner URLs. The script is available on my <a href="http://dowloads.thisisnotajoke.com/fixSlugs.txt">download</a> page or can be bought with a donation through my store.
