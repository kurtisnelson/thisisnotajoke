title: 'Linea Alba'

<p>Coruscum in medio linea alba meae.</p>

<p>The flashing white line sits in the middle of my life, waiting for input. I can keep feeding it for hours, and it never tires. It will always listen and regurgitate back to me unlike you.</p>

<p>Coruscum in medio linea alba meae non estis.</p>

<p>The flashing white line goes by my left and right, pulsing as I drive late at night. It guides me to my destination, making sure I stay on the straight and narrow, changing hue to yellow when I stray too far. It is the advisor that you are not.</p>

<p>In consuasor tu non es.</p>

<p>The flashing white line on the edges of the earth as I travel past, between the hills and the mountains, the buildings and the sky scrapers, the light coming in and out, over and over, but predictably there.</p>

<p>In extremis terrae.
Ego in extremis terrae habitetur quaerere.
Ego sum terra et Dei.</p>

<p>The flashing white line wants even more, but I have nothing left to give it. For unlike it, I tire, non sum deus. Sed Deus cognoscit quae videbimus.</p>
