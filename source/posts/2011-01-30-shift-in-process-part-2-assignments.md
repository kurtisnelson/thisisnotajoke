3:45 - The meeting begins. I'm getting paid now to sit on a bench for 15 minutes and only have to pay attention to grab one small bit of information: my position for the day. Today's coordinator and manager stand up front, saying nothing new or important, "don't leave your position", "make sure you know what you are doing", "two way .... good ..... not like that disaster...".

3:38 - They finally start running down the board. But first the old timers whine and bribe and claim they have to be escort today because they are tired. Except they were tired the day before and the day before that. The manager gives it to them for no reason. Backstage One, Two, Parade Escort One, Two, Firehouse VIP, Bridge VIP, Firehouse 1, 2, City Hall Disability 1,2, City Hall Crosswalk, 1, 2, one, two. Exposition Hall, Emporium One, Two, Pivot One, Two, Confectionery One, Two, Center Street East, Center Street West. Everyone listed so far breathes a sigh of relief, except Rick the poor trainer who has been stuck at City Hall Disability 1 for months with training groups. Next comes the most hellish section: Casey's one, two, window, Ice Cream one, two, window. Those 6 brave souls groan, everyone else still sits patiently waiting to see how their day will be. Hub corner east, west, hub disability, hub crosswalk east, west, castle 1, 2, 3, (plus plugs and ropes), then castle crosswalk north 1, 2, castle crosswalk south 1, 2 and the ever awkward castle corner. Everyone named so far gets up and goes, grabbing the best light wands for the easiest jobs. But tonight is not just any night, it's a 50k'er. We are staffed to the teeth, as close to new years as you can get, so the newbies are all remaining, waiting to hear what circle of hell they get assigned to.

3:35 - Here come the chutes. A captain for the west and east, plus as many spare bodies are available to help prod the cattle through. Exposition hall chutes are open tonight, this is where they stick the presentable bums. The bypass is coming out also, we have the joint bypass/expo chute captain who doesn't actually work here, just scmoozes with the managers constantly. The unpresentable bums are stuffed in the dark bypass where they don't have to speak, just have to stand there and point. I've still not been listed. That means they are saving me for the toughest spots, the ones that the regulars refuse to do but they know I am capable of. Hub Popcorn, bridge from hell east and west, Casey's Hopeless redirect one and two, Exposition Hall two, Tomorrowland bridge, Fantasy bridge redirect, and the Gazebo. And of course, that is where I end up. Again. For the third night in a row. At least I'm good at it, but today they didn't give me any backup. I talk to the manager and request more bodies, any bodies, and they say they will think about it. Which means no.

3:33 - I head down the stairs to the Parade Audience Control closet, grab two whole rolls of 3M Masking Tape, a blue light wand with dead batteries, and hang up my sanity.

End Act I.
