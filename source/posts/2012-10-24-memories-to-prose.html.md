title: 'Memories to Prose'

---

Pure prose flows from within. The world comes in and the world comes out. The little thinking machine has such a large capacity for memory, but unlimited capacity for creation. We can sit down at any time of day and make from our memory new memories, memories all the way down. Some people are better about diving back in than others, some people avoid memories as if they could reach out and bite, while some wallow in them ignoring the rest of the world. Somewhere in the middle is the right amount. Memories are there to be remembered, to be kernels of knowledge, to lead to wisdom, to guide the wise. Realize you need to remember and produce some prose manifesting your memories.
