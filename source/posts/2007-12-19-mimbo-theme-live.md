<img class="picleft" height="157" src="http://www.darrenhoyt.com/images/blog/mimbo2_preview.png" width="240">Kelson Consulting has now fully implemented the Mimbo theme on our site. Mimbo is a wordpress theme available for <a href="http://www.darrenhoyt.com/2007/08/05/wordpress-magazine-theme-released/" target="_blank">free</a>. I will be customizing the colors and such on the theme to my liking. From the Mimbo site:&nbsp; <blockquote> <p><em>Mimbo</em> is a magazine-style Wordpress theme which makes extensive use of <a href="http://www.darrenhoyt.com/2007/07/24/in-praise-of-wordpress-template-tags-part-ii-the-magazine-layout/">WPâ€™s template tag system</a> to create a non-traditional layout. It contains no images and only minimal CSS styling. Mainly it exists as a clean, grid-based starter layout for designers to install and style to their own liking:</p></blockquote>
