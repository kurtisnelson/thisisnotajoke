title: 'Fake Kroger Plus Card'

---

<p>So I got frustrated at having to keep track of and carry around a Kroger Plus Card, and I didn't want to have to register one with my personal details so I could use the alternate ID system. So I setup an anonymous card today with an alternate ID of 4048675309. It's really easy to use at self-checkout, just press the alternate ID button and enter it. I was going to figure out a way to make an app that would show the barcode, but apparently their scanners can not read screens. However, IKEA does support screens, so scan the below QR code or open the link on your iPhone to get an anonymous IKEA Family card added to PassBook.</p>
