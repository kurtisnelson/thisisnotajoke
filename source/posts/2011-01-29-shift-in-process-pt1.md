4:00 - I get out of my car, still putting on my belt. I grab my vest and poncho out of the trunk, and attempt to observe where I have parked my car after having circled for 10 minutes. I walk a random distance in a random direction and end up under the semi-circle. I rush just to wait, I hear the international Brazilians to the right speaking to each other in tired Portuguese. The VIP tin can pulls up, I wave any white card in the general direction of the blue man, and hop on in. The Tin Can sits for a bit, feeling when it should leave, suddenly taking off and lurching.

3:55 - After making a brief stop where the dress and wig wearers that reek of cigarettes hop on, I arrive at the fantastic entrance under the village house. I disembark the tin can that unfortunately I will have to cross paths with later. There is a hint of fries in the air, with a dash of Aramark. I walk briskly straight ahead, do a quick shuffle to the left to dodge a late gray shirt, and continue ahead. When I arrive at the junction, I grab the magic slip of papers that hold all the answers I don't want, but everyone else does. I continue ahead, straight, down, and under 200 foot buildings and 10,000 wild animals emerging eventually at the sound of jungle drums and the smell of hot dog cheese. Cutting across the very empty concrete lot that does not believe in tin cans, I turn the corner, only to be halted by a parade of absurdity. Heads go flying off, hands let go of hands, and lobsters show the bright pink on their inside all while dancing until they cross the magic white line. As the large presents round the corner to get ready again, I continue straight ahead. I go out the loud green gate into the show after checking my tie. Playful over-sized squirrels pass by in the opposite direction, no attention is given to them. Cutting right while trying to stay invisible I stop briefly to straighten the other magic slips of paper that hold the real answers that everyone ignores. I continue around the corner and through the door where the giver and taker of all that matters waits, the god-box. I punch in the 6 magic digits, 537848, hoping I did everything to it's satisfaction. Unfortunately I did not and it tells me I'm clueless. I pickup the line to the god-box gods and press their magic digits, 8880, 2, then 1. I inform them the god-box is wrong again, and they poke and prod it for a time just long enough to be worrisome but short enough to keep their hands clean.

3:46 - I try again, 537848, enter, pray, get assignment. The god-box gives me it's blessing, I turnabout and exit the door, trying to stay invisible as I round the corner, pass the rodents, open the green door, and run up the stairs to the Mother Office, 2. I sit down on the cold hard bench, and take advantage of the one small break I will have before all the trials ahead,

End Prelude.
