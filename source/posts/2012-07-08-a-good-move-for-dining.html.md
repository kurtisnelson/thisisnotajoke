<p>Georgia Tech Dining recently tweeted that they are looking to hire students, which should be an excellent move towards providing better quality of service.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>We want to hire students! July 10th, StuCen Theater, 7am-3pm. Starbucks Baristas, Cashiers (Subway, Chick-fil-a, Taco Bell) and IT Support.</p>&mdash; Georgia Tech Dining (@GTDining) <a href="https://twitter.com/GTDining/status/221244846705360897" data-datetime="2012-07-06T14:10:56+00:00">July 6, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p>Dining has always been known to have less than friendly employees, with many freshmen when asked about the dining hall employees responding with stories of being told they can't put ice cream in a cup or requests for pizza with normal toppings being dismissed. Many of the current front line dining employees are Atlanta unskilled labor lifers, who will be working those types of jobs their entire careers. Lifers do not have any connection to most GT Dining customers, as they live and work in completely different worlds.</p>
<p>Think about the last time you encountered an excellent customer service moment. Now think about the employee that made it happen. Most often, the employee and you connected through some common experience or difficulty. If you are taking a difficult class, who do you often feel is most helpful, the professor or the TAs? Tech students know what it is like to be a Tech student, and will likely be able to assist and problem solve effortlessly. There is the possibility for common topics for quick passing conversation, and opportunity for a customer - employee relationship to exist.</p>
<p>One GT Dining employee that has always stuck out in my mind was a student who worked in Woodruff my freshman year. Not only did he actually enjoy being there, he was not engaged with opaque conversation with his co-workers about missing child support or discussing the latest pop culture gossip. If Tech students are working, this type of employee can be standard.</p>
<p>Not only can this move improve customer service, but it makes business sense too. Tech students are generally absolutely overqualified for these types of jobs. This means the ones who do work care about the job and need money. This encourages them to have good attendance and perform well. A Tech student is going to be more efficient and better at the job than a lifer, as it is not as boring and dull as to someone who has been doing the job for years. Less intense training will be required, as learning an unskilled job is no more difficult than most tests that students take on a regular basis. This can make up for the higher turnover of student employees over lifers through quicker training and better on the job performance.</p>
<p>Overall if GT Dining can start having more students in customer facing roles, their brand and quality of product will be improved as students will be happy to perceive that their money is going into the pockets of fellow students instead of the faceless Sodexo behemoth. I'll be keeping a close eye on GT Dining and hopefully we will see that their product improves.</p>
