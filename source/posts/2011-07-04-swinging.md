title: Swinging

---

A dark cloud approaches. There is rumbling in the distance, it is dark, and getting darker. I still sit outside on the lawn, swinging back and forth, back and forth, for no reason. People scamper down the sidewalks faster than normal for no reason, the sky is just getting darker, no reason to fret. It swings back and forth with me on it, requiring prodding every couple to keep going. The rumbling is dark, and is getting darker, the sky is loud, and is getting louder. Yet I do not care. The sky does not rule me, the rumbling does not intimidate. I just keep swinging, back and forth, back and forth. Slowly, the world starts spitting at me. Larger and larger until it stings. Balls of water are now flinging themselves at me, but I just keep swinging. It will stop, I am in control of it, not it of me. It slows down like rain to a nice sprinkle. I keep on swinging.
