title: 'Sleep Typing'

---

I'm sleep typing. That nebulous stage where I really should crawl into bed, but don't feel like exerting the extreme effort to relocate myself 2 feet to the left and 3 feet vertically. I slip between conscious and unconscious, but continue typing, continue instant messaging, coding, texting, all the things one should only do while cognizant. But the best creativity falls in this uncanny valley, where I can say what I think without inhibitions for better or for worse, with no repercussions as long as I relegate it to a word document on my desktop, to be parsed and posted and post-consumed from a more perfect conscious state.
