title: 'NYE at Magic Kingdom'

---

Never having been to the theme parks on New Years Eve before, I decided to go to Magic Kingdom yesterday with the only goal of seeing Fantasy in the Sky. I arrived at 9:30AM as I knew the park would be having phased closings throughout the day. Pulling up to the parking booth was a bit scary.

I finally was able to park, finding myself way out in Donald at 9:30 in the morning. All that was left in the lot was Sneezy, Bashful, and a bit of Grumpy. Roughly 7500 of the 10000 spots were filled. Getting out of the car, there were massive crowds waiting for the trams. They were actually loading multiple trams simultaneously in an attempt to keep them moving.<!--more-->[ad#box]

Once at the TTC, I took the Mousehouse bus to the MK as the lines for watercraft and monorails were quite long.

The Magic Kingdom entry plaza was a complete zoo, with lines backing up all over.

In total, it took me about 45 minutes from getting out of my car to getting in the gate. By the time I got in the gate at 10:15, Alternate Parking was in effect and the park went Phase 3 around 11:15. Wait times were pretty bad until about 9PM, when the non-priority attractions finally reached normal waits. Here are the waits around 10AM.

This was the crowd for the 11AM Move It Shake It Celebrate It. As busy as a normal day parade.

Noon day parade was absolute insanity, it was as busy as a normal season DLP.

The crowds for the noon parade were so bad turnstiles just gave up and closed off the left entrance to mainstreet to force everyone to use the bypass.

Full bypass was open from 11:45 until 12:45, allowing guests to travel from Tony's or Plaza to Buzz Lightyear or Lightyear to Tony's. After about 5PM, the park started getting insane as all 70,000 guests started to move towards Mainstreet for the festivities.

Yes, that's a solid crowd. And here's the aftermath right after fireworks:

Throughout the night, the park flow was adjusted to try and keep people off of Mainstreet. Two bypasses were setup, the Baby Bypass from Crystal Palace to Firehouse, and the Full Bypass, which had a party in the middle of it. Not only were all the tables chairs and benches from Mainstreet moved back there for seating, but they had Glo-merch, ODF, and Balloons available. The Mainstreet managers had planned on acquiring fancy port-a-potties for it too, but ran out of budget. In all, it could hold about 5,000 guests for fireworks viewing while still acting as a thoroughfare.

Most of the night, mainstreet was only accessible by going all the way down to townsquare. At about 11:30PM, Mainstreet was roped off at the confectionary and emporium with no access going north. I made a diagram of the setup, the plain red lines are places were ropes and cast members were restricting flow towards the castle. The two bypasses were also forced, if you headed towards Casey's from Adventureland, you were forced into Baby Bypass, same if you tried to exit mainstreet via Noodle Station.

Post fireworks, the queue for exit transportation was backed all the way up north of townsquare. There is free hot chocolate and cookies after midnight (leftovers from MVMCP) as an attempt to slow down people's exit. After the midnight fireworks, the queues for everything except Space Mountain were 20 minutes or less. I delayed exiting until about 01:20. I once again took mousehouse to avoid waits and still waited about 20 minutes for a bus out. At 00:20, the mousehouse line was 50 minutes once you got to it. On the other side of the lagoon, the tram lines were backed up to the vacation planning booths so I walked out. As soon as  I pulled out of the lot exit row onto the main parking loop, traffic was at a standstill all the way to Osceola parkway. In total, the time for me to leave property from the turnstiles was about an hour and a half. Overall, it was a very unique adventure that I would recommend people should do at least once given that they expect to ride nothing in the park, do not have young children, and have the stamina to be standing for over 10 hours. Fantasy in the Sky is an excellent show that really should be seen. If you have young kids or a large group, the crowds become a problem as it is incredibly easy to get separated and splitting up is a bad idea due to the restricted flow.
