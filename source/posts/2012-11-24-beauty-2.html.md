Beauty is what the eye sees and the brain believes is wonderful. In every case it is different, for some it is only pure nature, while for others it might consist of man-made cities. Either way, what is beauty does not matter, only that it is. Beauty is often sad, as the heart can't tolerate the pureness of it on it's own. Beauty has a taste, a sweetness but coupled with the burn of a fine dry wine. Often it unfolds on the tongue, a story, a process, not instantaneous. Drinking of the beauty is not just something you can do, but must prepare for, prepare the mind, body, soul, and be wanting of it. It does not just appear, but must be sought out, brought to the surface, often completely hidden from view.

But other times it is right there, for all to see, and everyone chases after it. is it better to pursue the hidden or to allow the plain to fall into your hands? While the hidden may be stronger, the plainÂ  is far easier.

I choose to find both, that which at first sight is wonderful, but upon further perusal, is even more so. For I've got one chance to find the purest beauty I can find, and I had better do well in locating it.
