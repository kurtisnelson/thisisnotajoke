title: 'The Ultimate Stupid Guest'

<p>This is completely not my story but is from a great forum I am a member of for theme park employees and such. It's a semi-private forum so I am reproducing it here for public consumption.</p>
<blockquote>Jaws was dry for the first few weeks of May, so all the Skippers were homed to new attractions for a while. My roommate ended up at Simpsons. One night, she comes home absolutely FUMING, stomps into the living room and yells, "GORDON! Have I got a story for you!!!"
She was working grouper on level 2 when family approached with a child who was clearly too short to ride. My roommate informed the woman that the child would need to be measured because the height requirement was...
SG: Fifty Inches! I KNOW. She's tall enough!
TM: Well, maam' our height requirement is 40" and I still have to measure her.

The woman protested loudly; but in the end that child was measured and found to be several inches too short to ride the ride. The TM informed the SG of Universal's child swap policies and directs the family (minus the child and mother) into the correct line. She turns around a little later and sees the family still in line; but this time the mother is with them and there is no sign of the child. She thinks its a little weird but decides to let the loader deal with them.

Well....turns out she was the loader since she got bumped to the next position just as the family was entering the car. The TM puts on her "happy face" and loads the guests in the car but notices that the mother now was a large duffel bag with her that she is trying to shove under the seat.

TM: I'm sorry ma'am that bag is too large to ride. It will have to go against the wall.
SG: THIS BAG STAYS WITH ME
TM: The bag will not be leaving the room, it's just not safe for it to ride with you..."
SG: THIS IS RIDICULOUS! I'M RIDING WITH MY BAG

The SG stands up to make her point and as she lifts the bag it wiggles.

TM: Ma'am...Did you put your CHILD in that bag?!
SG: HOW DARE YOU INSULT MY PARENTING SKILLS!! WHAT KIND OF PERSON WOULD..."

the bag coughs.

TM: Ma'am. I'm only going to say this once and then I'm going to call security. You need to leave. Right. Now.
SG: BUT...BUT...BUT...
TM: BUT, BUT, BUT...GET OUT!!!


and all I got to do for the Dry was wave a stuffed cow at Twister.</blockquote>
