Make sure you start with <a href="http://thisisnotajoke.com/2011/01/29/shift-in-process-pt1/">Part I</a>

1:35 - The parade has finally reached the hub. I see Tinkerbell rounding the corner on her large bulbous float. Float is a misnomer here, crush is more appropriate. The reason there are always dancers in the front of any parade is to provide a buffer in case people are not properly out of the street in time. In that case, we get a nice talking to afterwards at The Green Umbrella, but at least no one gets flattened. Once the parade reaches your zone, Guests don't seem to comprehend that in fact, the crosswalks still need to remain as clear as before. The wall of people I have been holding back onto the bridge start to move in, I have to plant myself in front of them to keep them from filling in the beautiful pathway I have spent the last hour keeping clear. Little do they understand that Snow White is human and might get tired from having greeted 12,000 Guests and be about to pass out. We wouldn't want a fainted princess would we? Plus, there is the occasional need for an alpha run smack dab in the middle of the hub in the middle of the parade. It's already hard enough to get a stretcher across the parade route, much less through the crowd. People stop in the middle of the pathway, not even moving to the side anymore to do so. At least that makes it easier to block their view and ask them to continue along. As long as they are moving though, I have no problem, even if it is a man walking a stroller back and forth over the same 100ft for two. hours.

1:30 - Here come the donkey boys. For whatever reason, the asses bring out the asses. The guests think, oh, crazy guys dancing in the street, it must be ok to run across the route now. Contrary to popular belief, the asses in the street are much further trained than the asses on the sidewalk and actually know what they are doing.
