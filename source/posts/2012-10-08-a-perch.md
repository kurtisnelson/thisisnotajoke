title: 'A Perch'

---

He's on a perch looking down at the room that is jumping for <strong>JOY!</strong> I'm in there somewhere, but it doesn't quite feel like here. But I start moving ever so slightly with the crowd, starting to feel the presence. It's here, but am I? No one is still. Sung is singing, the glum are singing, the broken are very much alive.

I'm still here, in the distant center, looking forward, looking on, but not <em>here</em>. What must I do to move the last few inches, to fully arrive, to always be here? Sometimes I sit, alone, not here, but over there, across the mountain, down a hill, in a slumber. I don't want to stand up, walk a couple feet over, and join the party. But I should. I should be here. Now. Right now. And I'm sad inside. I don't want to wake up, to move, just sit there and ponder tomorrow. What is wrong? It's so simple to join the party. But I can't. But I should.

For some reason, I can't control myself, I hear my name, I hop down from the perch, run up, and join the party for a moment. But then I return. I can't stay for too long or I am distanced there too. And a tiny short distance is the worst.

But I'm getting closer. But not actually moving closer. Just measuring the micron gap correctly for the first time. I just need to acknowledge the crack in the sidewalk and not step on it.
