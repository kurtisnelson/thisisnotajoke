You win some and you lose some. Pick your battles. Great advice for those actually in control of the military. The civilian has no call, they can't pick the battle or are prepared for the fight. They just choose to put themselves out there and see what comes at them and hope they survive. The trained private has no call, they can't pick the battle or the fight, but when it comes, they are prepared. This is the difference between foolishness and faith.

When the wrestler goes into the ring, they are not there to fight or to win, but to put on a show. They may fight, they may win, they may cower, they may lose. But in the end, it doesn't matter as long as the audience is engaged. What is the show and who is the audience? This does not matter, as the show should be you and the audience no one.
