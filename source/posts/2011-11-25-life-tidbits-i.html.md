If you are unhappy with something, fix it.

If you are unhappy with someone, communicate it.

Controlled rants are good, they let you organize your thoughts.

A blog post is often just a controlled rant.

Are you a conversation circle floater or commiter?

Stand your ground when confronted until you get a full scope of the situation.

Politics and religion are a great discussion item, but only in small groups.
