I don't know if this is the most recent working version, but I think it is. Also, I really wanted to post this anyways. Please let me know if you beat it or you find any bugs.

The program uses a depth-first game tree search and heuristics to come to the correct answer. In less than a second, it comes to the best move thinking about 7 moves in advance. The difficulty is how far ahead it thinks. Please enter integers - I tried to idiot proof it but wasn't completely successful.
