I now own a virtual private server with cPanel and centOS powering it. All of my hosting customers are being moved to it. With it, I hope to provide speedier support and higher customization available. The server has 512MB of RAM, and 3 dedicated IP addresses. Also comes the ability for me to now vend reseller accounts which allow unlimited, seperate domains under them, each with their own cPanel.
