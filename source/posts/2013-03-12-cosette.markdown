I lay still in my bed, staring at the ceiling, wondering, imagining, longing for my Cosette. Right now a ghost to me, a memory from my future. But in that future my wife, my life all together in oneness, together always, never alone.

But now I must wait, for the one.
But now I must rest, for what is to come.
Now I will wait, for the one.
Now I will rest, for what is to come.
For what is to come is the one for me, one with me, together.

For it is not what I want now, but what he wants for me, for to be one with him will only further in becoming one with her. For she was given to me by him, the one true bride, the bride that must be embraced, the veil lifted, and made one.

Now I am one, and later still one, and past one too. And in this case, one and one makes a stronger one, a deeper one, a one that cannot be broken down to none.

For someday, I will have Cosette, today I might already. But what one has is not always realized now but later, one becoming cognizant with time. But for now I must lie in wait for there is not much I can do in the time of man, only the cosmos.

But I do know for a fact one day I will have Cosette, and that day will be perfect.
