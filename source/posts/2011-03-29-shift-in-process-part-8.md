<p>1:25 - Pete and his dragon are still as annoying as ever. We'd really be happy if Elliot did his trick and actually stayed disappeared. The world would also be better if Pete just would hit puberty. But this is Disney World, no one ages and the children stay children even when they still shouldn't be. Adults become children here too. Walt always wanted this, but I'm not sure he realized how childish the adults could become. When the adults get upset that Mickey has to take a cheese break or go home for the day and they won't be able to get a picture with him *right* this second even though they had all day. Or they walk up to that one attraction that is the most important component of their entire trip, a minute after close on the last day of their trip. Priorities and logical thinking are irrelevant to children, the id rules all.<br>
1:20 - Here come the dancers slash safety barriers. Only at Disney would the people who guard the massively large float be lit up in patriotic colors. The wing dancers are actually the emergency breaks and the graceful dancers can quickly break character and tackle a street headed child if needed. Now that the parade has ended, the real fun begins. It's time for two-way.</p>
