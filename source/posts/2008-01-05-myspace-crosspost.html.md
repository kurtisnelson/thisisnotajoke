Even though I hate MySpace, I am making an attempt at using it. This blog has now been setup to automatically post a copy to my MySpace profile in an attempt to show people what a real blog looks like. And this way, I never even have to see the MySpace interface! Also if anyone knows of a Wordpress plugin that will allow me to crosspost to another WP blog, tell me about it!
