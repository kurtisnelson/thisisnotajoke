At <a href="http://highgroove.com">Highgroove</a>, we all have company Macbooks. I had a Macbook of my own once upon a time, and thus had an apple id with some purchases on it and about $20 credit. So of course, the reasonable thing to do is to hook it up to my new one. But in the years since, it got disabled for whatever reason. Apple's now been bumming around for 2 weeks trying to figure out how to enable it, and they basically said they don't know how. The real kicker is they can't even transfer my existing ticket over to whatever department can. Lesson: You don't own anything you buy electronically from Apple.

>Hi Kurt,
> This is Chris with the iTunes Store support team. Lizzie is not available to follow up right now and I want to ensure this is resolved for you as soon as possible.

> Kurt, unfortunately the iTunes Store and the Account Security team do not have contact with each other.
> Your account was originally disabled due to unauthorized or fraudulent purchases. Apple takes these cases very seriously and the account was disabled for your protection.
> We also don't have telephone support so we unfortunately we can't call them and conference you over to the external number.
>
> If you are unable to submit a case online, it may be easier to call them directly at:
>
> (800) APL-CARE (800-275-2273)
>
> Just tell Apple Care that you need to speak with the Account Security team. If the hold time is long, you may also be given the option to receive a callback.
> I hope this helps Kurt. The iTunes Store unfortunately does not have the authority to handle this request.
> 
> Have a great day. If you have any trouble, let me know.
