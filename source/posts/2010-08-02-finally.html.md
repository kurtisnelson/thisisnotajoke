So I'm very happy for once I get to write a positive blog post about GT Dining.

Our new full service Chick-Fil-A opened this month, and they finally got customer service right. The workers take initiative, if you are standing around for more than a minute waiting on your number to be called, the cashiers will ask what you had and personally assemble it.
In addition, when I went to get a refill on my Diet Coke once, they noticed they were almost out of syrup and the brix was off. So instead of just handing me my drink, they went back and changed the syrup out instead of standing around. They apologized for the slowness. That is good, regular, customer service. What makes this excellent customer service is they silently gave me a larger drink back instead of the same size. This is a basically free gesture on their part but is noticed by the customer and is appreciated.

I don't know what GT Dining did, but all the staff at the new chick-fil-a consists of their friendliest best staff from around campus.
