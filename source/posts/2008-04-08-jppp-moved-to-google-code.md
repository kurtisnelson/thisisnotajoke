jPPP now has a repository along with forthcoming documentation. All releases will now be downloaded at <a title="http://code.google.com/p/javappp/" href="http://code.google.com/p/javappp/">http://code.google.com/p/javappp/</a> The most up-to-date version is in a zip file in the main repository. jPPP now matches with the codes coming off of the GRC website.
