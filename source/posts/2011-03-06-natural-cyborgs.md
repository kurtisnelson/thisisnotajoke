How close to being cyborgs are we? I'd say very close.

There’s quite a bit of irony in my current situation. I’m sitting here at my computer desk, with music playing, typing into this, and watching a news feed go by all as I read a book discussing the implications of cybernetics. I’m perfectly fine admitting that humans are already a form of cyborg, but not in the most optimal way. Andy Clark seems to think that cybernetics do not require penetrating the skin-bag at all, and are capable of existing perfectly fine in that manner. But this approach requires we spend much time developing easy to use intuitive interfaces. I think the only reason we do not directly interface with the nervous system is that biotechnology has not had time to catch up with technology. If we can safely and securely connect physically with our devices we would as it would allow us to use them faster and better. A lower level connection is needed for us to subconsciously and autonomously use devices in the same way we subconsciously use our internal devices, if you have to reach for a device in your pocket and turn it on, it is already less effective than a device that is able to present itself to you in a ready state on demand.
