title: 'Shifting Planes'

---

<p>Flat circles, moving around on a plane. A stack of 8 planes on top of one another, touching but unrelated. A new circle grows from a point, expanding, moving, but never translating between the planes. The planes shift, their transparent figures masking the circles as they drift, change color, move. One slowly slides too far to the side, tilting, no longer in step with the others, and falls to the ground, shattering, the circles becoming dark fragments on the ground, the plane ceasing to exist, the others just falling back together in step.</p>

<p>He approaches the stack of planes on their stand, and looks down. When he designed this piece of art, the planes were clear, the viewer could see straight through to the bottom, the entire picture. But now they are clouded, the circles on every plane causing the bottom of the stack to vanish. Black circles all the way through. He looks at the piece that has fallen to the ground, how even without it the work is still opaque. And the circles just keep growing, melding, running into each other. The once vibrantly colors points have run together into a deep, black mass. The art is ruined, now a failed experiment, not even worthy of the walls of his own home.</p>

<p>He touches the stack, once warm when formed, the glass now cool to the touch. The work is gone, done, finished. It must be replaced with a new one that shows the beauty of the frame he placed it in.</p>

<p>He takes the work, gives it a gentle push, and the planes start to fall.</p>

<p>The planes fall, like cards being shuffled, reunited in purpose, reunited in the air, becoming one falling object subject to the laws of physics. No longer art, shifting planes, moving circles, but a plummeting mass in motion, full of momentum, headed straight for the hard, cold, ground of his studio. The edges of the planes begin to touch the floor, each plane gathering a spider web of diffractions upon it, loosing their shape, their characters, their colors, shattering, and becoming nothing more than a pile of coarse, melded, sand.</p>
