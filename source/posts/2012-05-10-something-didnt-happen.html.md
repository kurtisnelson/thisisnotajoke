title: 'Something didn''t happen'

---

The boy walks into the room and notices the amount of men waiting. They are all happily sitting in chairs, quietly staring into nothing. None of them notice him. He quietly takes a chair in the corner and sits down. Nothing happens. The men around keep staring, their eyes blank, minds blank, senses quiet. Nothing is happening. But then his ears adjust to the quiet. He hears it in the distance. A faint voice. It sounds like a spring day in a meadow, quiet, soft, green, fresh. Unbelivably fresh. It says, just wait, I'll be right there. He looks around the room. No one else seems to have noticed. Their eyes continue with blank stares, nothing changed. Nothing happened. The boy wonders why he is here, and if it is ever going to happen. He resolves that if all these other men are waiting for it he might as well too. The voice is there again, as faint as before. It says nothing, but is heard. "It'll talk to me when it is time." The hum of the environment around him can no longer be noticed. The drip in the air conditioner, gone. It's a peaceful bliss. He might as well just sit it out, it can't be much longer and it is so peaceful. Nothing happens. "The voice will come to me, I've been told that is what it does." He sits. And sits, waiting for the sweet voice to come get him. 

What he doesn't notice is no one else has moved. They've been there just as long if not longer. What all of them have failed to do is simply walk up to the receptionist and ask if it is their turn. If he did, he'd find that it was ready for him and something would happen.
