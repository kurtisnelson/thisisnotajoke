title: 'Encouragement for a stranger'

---

I knew him in high school, but not that well. We were incredibly different people then, and still are now, but somehow, God brought him here. To party. But not just to party, to lea d the party, to pour everclear into girls' faces, to get a friend drunk beyond good decision, to encourage sin, to provoke it, and to aid it. He womanizes plainly and clearly, and g
irls like it. How are people this broken? Where is God in this? For whatever reason, I went to this party. I didn't drink anything, I pulled the empty solo cup in hand move. And he
performed in front of the crowd. He worked the crowd into a frenzy, a wild excited craze, yet they were all excited for the wrong reason. Why can't we get this crowd excited about G
od?

Afterwards, I hung out with him. He fed a girl's poor self-image, he encouraged her to doubt herself. He made her uncomfortable the whole night, yet she enjoyed it and never pushed
back. I tried to convince her to think good things about herself, but she ignored my pleas. I walked her drunk, lost self back to her apartment, a girl I had met only hours before,
but felt so sad for. She is beautiful, and seems to be quite intelligent, but she just lets it all go to waste on drugs, alcohol, and men. I left her my calling card with the note t
hat if she ever needs anything, she is more than welcome to reach out. I hope that message sticks.
