title: 'Fall of the Freshman: The Army'

Do they not see what happens around them?
Are they naive as to the purpose of the men encircling them?

The wise men sit on the edge, praying for them to learn, to notice, to join their ranks.
But they are blind to them, only noticing those encircling them.

They get attention, a private army of attention, at their beck and call for them.
They don't know why them are around them, but that they are there and there for them.

The wise men say from the edge: Ignore them, for they are not who they claim to be.
But they discard their wisdom, only listening to those attending to them.

But then the army changes allegiance, a new General is in town. The old one gets thrown aside, tossed to the wind, and forgotten.
Only then do they listen, and they listen hard.
