For years, I had wanted to see the utilidors, know the capacities, be able to calculate the wait time in my head, and know the locations of all the secret doors in The Magic Kingdom. I finally got to enter that world.

I've always wanted to work in The Magic Kingdom but have known that to do so would require submitting myself to "that" work world. That $7.25/hour world. The world that my world has always told me to avoid, a dead end. But this Fall, I had the chance to enter it on occasion, taste the forbidden fruit, and enjoy it. Albeit, I did have an advantage of it all being overtime, bumping it up to the downright posh $10.87 world. Still, I'd be willing to do it for $7.25.

In "that" world, you have yourself, your voice, and your hands. No desk to sit in front of, no overflowing outlook inbox or hour long meetings on how to introduce diversity to the office. The earth is your office, the weather your pace car, the season your mood, and your Sunday a Saturday or maybe a Friday or two. Your day is about point A to point B. No detours needed, your lunch handed to you, the clock running your bladder, and the silent boss the timepunch watching over you. Check in on the way in, put your brain on the shelf if you want, keep yourself occupied for 8 hours, punch out. Go home, forget the day, sleep, eat, drink, whatever you think (or don't think).

Then exit that world.

At least <em>I</em> have that choice. And that is what lets me get through it. If I don't like the work, I leave. If I'm tired, I work less. If I'm brimming with energy, next Thursday my pockets brim with money. Ah, there's the catch. Even at a seemingly glorious overtime rate of $10.87, it's less than squat per year. $22,000 dollars. Before your taxes. Just barely above the supposed 4 person household poverty line. If all you do is work, it's fine. But you can only handle 60 hours a week for so long. When you're down to 40, you have all this free time, time to spend but no money to spend in it. You sit on the couch and wither, watching football any time you are home. Heavily drinking cheap booze to pass the time. But then there goes your paycheck. You slide back in the hole, the dirt wall sliding down as you climb up it, scampering like an ant in the sand. Not a place to be.

But as far as climbing down into that hole as long as you have a ladder in place to come back out? Go for it. You will come out for the better.
