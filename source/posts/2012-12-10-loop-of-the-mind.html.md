title: 'Loop of the Mind'

---

<p>An infinite loop of the mind. A dream that mixes the reality of your bed with the illusions of your subconscious. You can get trapped in a situation in a dream and not escape until the reality of it sets in, that you have a real problem that must be dealt with. How often are we just trapped in the problem of a dream and not one of reality? A problem that is just a projection of a dangerously real one, one that actually affects our being. So often our problems are infinite loops of our mind, scoped such that we cannot see out of them, but knowing distantly that there is an outer set, the set of harsh real reality, versus the warm, abstracted land of our mind.</p>
