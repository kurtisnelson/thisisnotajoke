A what is wrong with my brain moment brought to you by caffeine and a lack of sleep. Hey, with the internet even the most worthless information can and should be shared, right?
<h3>A useful life tip</h3>
Watching and observing people is one of the simplest forms of learning in this world. Dealing with people themselves on the other hand is one of the most illogical and insane processes on earth. No amount of learning is useful in an indeterministic system where cause and effect don't act like cause and effect. Predicting the outcome of Schrodinger's cat is safer than predicting the output of the female species since men don't have nine lives.
<h3>And to be taken light heartily...</h3>
When probability is your only friend in a game of cards, you're playing poker.

What good is knowing the time when you are already late? Stop looking at your watch and run.

Instead of just sitting there and complaining about the problem, tell me what you are going to do about it. This way you can be made fun of later instead of me then complaining about you, raising the net happiness value of the overall situation.
