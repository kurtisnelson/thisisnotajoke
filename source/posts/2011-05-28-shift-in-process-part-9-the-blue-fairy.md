As soon as the parade rounds the corner, I start ripping tape off the ground. At this moment, I am supposed to be two places at once. Good show is demanding. I backtrack the parade route a bit finding the other blue wands waving in the air. I hop in the line, for the quickest exit please stay to the right, raise my wand in the air, please stay to the right, and start waving it back and forth. Stay to the right. About here is where you are tired of it. Is humanity so clueless and selfish to not do such a simple thing such as staying to the right of a pathway? It takes 40 people an hour at $7.25 each to keep humanity from stopping itself in the street and trapping itself. We stand and wait for that blue fairy, our favorite Disney property. She makes it all end, when she appears, we go home. Until she appears, STAY to the RIGHT.

Oh look, it's the blue fairy!

My favorite line from any Disney any thing. Our arms come down, we duckling out down the street, swing right towards first aid, and disappear into the wall. With a fireworks finale behind us, we walk towards the cooler only to presented with the cheapest refreshing option the union will allow, and grab ourselves a cup of Squencher. We down it, and before trudging to the clock we have to throw away our cups. I walk up to the computer, hit my six numbers, enter, enter and I now get paid to walk back through the park, trudge down the utilidors, wait for the bus, and figure out where I put my car 4 hours ago. I collapse at home in my bed, remembering I have to be at my real job in 8 hours at 8am.

At least I can escape. Some have been here for 20 years, day after day, doing this same process. I do it when I choose to. Other do it because it chooses them for life.
