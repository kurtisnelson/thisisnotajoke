...and wants us to get robbed.

Today I got an email from GT Housing saying my apartment door had been recored. We went though this last week too and could not figure out why they changed it, none of us had lost our keys. When I went in today to swap my key out (again) this is what I found out:
One of the previous residents of our apartment had never returned their keys. Check in/out was over a month ago. They finally got around to recoreing a month later. Today I asked why it took so long to recore, their excuse was that there were tons that needed doing. The reason for the second recore a week later was that they had messed up and not tracked it properly so they could not get into our apartment.
First absurdity: They had known for over a month that someone else still had a key and never told us this.
Second absurdity: When it is us who have a safety problem, they take a month to fix it. When they can't get into our apartment and it is their problem, they fix it within a week.
You would think they would prioritize the recores that were safety issues of no fault of the current residents over people who just lost their key. I kind of wish we had been robbed, as housing would have been probably considered criminally negligent.
