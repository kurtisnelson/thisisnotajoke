I've been noticing tons of friends getting like-jacked on Facebook recently. The scheme they are getting hit with is very simple and super easy to fall into if you are not aware of it. Basically, any page can cause you to like it purely by clicking anywhere on it. There is a safe to play with <a href="http://erickerr.com/like-clickjacking">click jacking demo</a>. The current way this is getting passed around is as links with eye-catching headers showing up in your feed. First and foremost, look before clicking on the page, many of these have "FouTube" integrations. Second, take a look at the domain. Most of the domains being used are long and cumbersome to type, which is a tell tale sign of a burner domain. If you get hit by this like jack, don't worry, all you need to do is go to your profile and remove the item. No need to change your password, as it is not compromised.
There are many of these like button tricks: <a href="http://arnab.org/blog/reputation-misrepresentation">http://arnab.org/blog/reputation-misrepresentation</a>
