So sometimes you need to pick a Linux distribution to install on a machine that is possibly going to be up and running for a really long time. Here's a diagram of the lifecycles for Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Debian, and Ubuntu. Basically if you want long term support, always go with RHEL. (I made this for my <a href="http://lugatgt.org/2012/01/25/linux-for-the-enterprise-red-hat-kickstart-and-spacewalk/">LUG@GT Linux for the Enterprise</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wUNWmbw_kzsPjJvc8b9wjqvZD0-rQd_VGML9anDFYuc/edit">presentation</a>)
