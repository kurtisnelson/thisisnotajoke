title: 'Swimming Sick'

---

I feel like I am in a swimming pool, swimming around the bottom. I hear only the high pitched whine of my nervous system, and the deep hum of my heart pumping. I'm holding my breath as long as I can and barely staying afloat. I can barely remember what I just did, and the words right now just flow through my head. You could tell me anything and I would nod in agreement. I crawl into my bed and attempt to sleep, but keep waking up. I'm still swimming while in bed. It's peaceful yet a problem.

I sit back, I relax. And it all floods in. Even though physically I am exhausted and sick, I still can feel it all. I just have to pause briefly, sit down, and wait. It all comes flooding in without asking, I just have to be ready.

Yet, when it's done, I'm still swimming. But now I'm swimming on the surface, hydroplaning, moving forward, making progress. I still hear the same sounds, but I also hear the water, I hear my breath, I hear the world. It's tiring to swim while sick, but in the end, it is worth it.
