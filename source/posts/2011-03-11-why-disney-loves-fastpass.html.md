It is all about the overall utilization of the park (utilization in the stochastic sense) Internally, WDW divides attractions into 3 categories: FP Preferred Attractions, non-FP preferred, and non-preferred. FP is removed from an attraction if it falls into the non-preferred bin, IE Philhar and Stitch. In addition, what actually matters is utilization during sustained demand. On a design day, sustained demand for preferreds occurs from noon to 3PM. This is the time of day where cast performance really makes a difference in utilization. During the other times, if there is not sustained demand (which basically means a wait of &gt;15 minutes), utilization is a useless metric. Before fastpass, the utilization of preferred attractions during sustained demand was already at 99% or more (Space often breaks 100% utilization). But for the non-preferreds, utilization was low, think 50-60%, leaving tons of capacity for Guests to be doing something other than waiting. With fastpass, the overall park utilization increases. This means, on average, more rides per capita. RPC is what drives park hours and staffing, for Magic Kingdom everything that can feasibly done is done to keep RPC above 8.0. (This is where we hit union limitations and business rules, such as minimum turn around times between close and open.) So with fastpass, it benefits both the business and the customer, on average, the customer experiences a higher RPC at a same or lesser cost for the business. This has lead to an increase in utilization at the C-tickets, actually giving justification for refurbs of things such as TTA and the Worldshowcase attractions. Plus the best benefit: During no fastpass periods (EMH, hard ticket), the lines feel even shorter because of the speed at which they move.

Note: Universal really should take note of this stuff, it'd improve the experience greatly. In addition, I found it surprising how much I learned without having any type of NDAs or other protections.
