Anyone else find the quality of this email quite entertaining? I think working for them would end up in a visit to <a href="http://thedailywtf.com">The Daily WTF</a>.
I think it's a higher unprofessional wording and the use of the term xCode Master shows cluelessness. Sadly I think this type of "development" is on the rise with everyone thinking they are capable of making iOS apps.
<blockquote>Hi there,

We are looking for a local iPad developer for a special project immediately! We are located in Clearwater, FL. Phase 1 will take 2-3 days. The individual we choose will work under an xCode Master and the project is fully specked/mapped out. Please contact us if you or someone you know qualifies. Proficiency needs to be very high to qualify. We will offer a salaried position for Phase 2 if you are interested. And we are nice. Let us know!
