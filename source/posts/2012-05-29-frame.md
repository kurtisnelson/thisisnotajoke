The streets are dead, empty, quiet- yet the view is so loud. Large polygons abound, lines everywhere, no organic curves, just I. I'm the shapeless in the land of the shapen. The nature in the land of the made. Alone on the street, standing out more than a deer in the headlights. There's still noise, white noise, nonsensical noise. It's as predictable as a sawtooth wave, constant and droning, unnatural and ethereal. My footsteps are uneven, non-rythmic, pausing. I stand in place, the world now a constant around me the one variable. If I stop, the change stops, everything goes constant, the slope zero. If I move, time progresses, if I pause, the world freezes in a frame around me. The world has frozen, I the lone process still running. How long can I run before I too lose energy and am absorbed into the whole?
